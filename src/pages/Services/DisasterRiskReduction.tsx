            <Paragraph>
                The first disaster response Nature’s Club was involved was 1999 super cyclone. We worked in many a sector like cleaning of traditional water sources in Kendrapara Municipality, Hygiene campaign in Rajnagar block with OXFAM, Measles immunization drive with UNICEF and District administration, Community based rehabilitation of orphans and destitute with Actionaid, in rehabilitation and reconstruction work with Care India, CBDP with UNDP and district administration. We gained rich experience which propelled us to the lead organization in following disasters like Floods, cyclones and Tornado. Nature’s Club was the District NGO Coordinator for Disaster response from 2000 to 2002.

            <br />
            <Paragraph>
                We evolved with Disaster management process of GoO, GoI and by working closely with International and National organizations. From disaster preparedness to disaster mitigation to Disaster management to Disaster Risk Reduction and finally Child centric DRR. As a child rights organization children remained as our focus in all the response, rehabilitation and reconstruction programs. We worked with Save the Children in Child Centric DRR from 2011 to 2013 in Rajnagar block and since then CCDRR has became one of our mainstreaming subject.
                Resilient children and resilient communities are the goal of CCDRR.
