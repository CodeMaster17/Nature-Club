                We got the opportunity to continue promoting solar technology as grid independent energy solution for household energy needs called Integrated Domestic Energy System (IDES) which addresses energy needs for cooking, Lighting and mobile charging. Improvised cook stoves (ICS) are designed for (1) No smoke, (2) Less fuel wood and (3) Less cooking time.
