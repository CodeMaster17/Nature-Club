            <Paragraph>
                The old saying &quot;Health is Wealth&quot; has the same value today despite all the developments in the world. Nutrition, especially of mothers and children is still the subject of concern in this modern world. 45% of children of Odisha are undernourished and it&quot;s a big number. Quality health care is right of every human being.

            <Paragraph>
                Care and Support with love is the key for long life of person living with HIV. We also wish them to live long as they will take care of their children and see that children are grown up and capable of taking care of themselves and also rendering other social duties. Project Anand was conceived on the idea to support children infected and affected with HIV and AIDS with basic nutritional supplement, educational stationary and Hygiene kit. It&quot;s just to say to them that they should not feel left alone, stigmatized and there are people who know them and care for them. Project Anand provided psychosocial care to Children infected and affected with HIV and AIDS and PLHIVs of more than 40 Families in Kendrapara district. Lack of fund has limited our support to these children and their parents.

As required under project guidelines we have facilitated convergence of services through project management committee, crisis management committee, hot spot committee and DIC level committee. Prevention to new infection is minimized with condom promotion activities. We also did issue based interventions in case of stigma and discrimination towards PLHIV and family.

            <Paragraph>
                Complete Immunization to every child and mother is our national target. Though we have a huge and well placed health care system with outreach presence in all the habitations, we have not yet achieved the target. Vaccination at the accessible distance and regular vaccination sessions   are key to minimize the gap. Nature&quot;s Club has been supporting Rajnagar block health administration in vaccine delivery on all the regular vaccination sessions in all 26 health sub-centres under Rajnagar CHC. We are happy to be a part of the great endeavor.
