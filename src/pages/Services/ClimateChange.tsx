                Climate change is increasingly threatening lives, habitat and livelihood, the most in the circle of Bay of Bengal. With much collective efforts humans are acting on DRR (Disaster risk reduction) with emphasis on saving human lives. But in a very restricted agrarian community like in Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary area along with its outer stretch of eco-sensitive zone where the livelihood practice is one-crop rain fed paddy and second is fishing; to live with dignity and enough food, protection of livelihood is the foremost for communityâ€™s resilience to disaster and climate change. Regeneration of mangroves, sustainable management of mangroves and eco-friendly farming practices the only option left with us to honor the legal regulations associated with the protected areas (Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary, Bhitarkanika National park, Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary and Eco-sensitive zone) and to face the changing climate.
