            <Paragraph>
                Climate change is increasingly threatening lives, habitat and livelihood, the most in the circle of Bay of Bengal. With much collective efforts humans are acting on DRR (Disaster risk reduction) with emphasis on saving human lives. But in a very restricted agrarian community like in Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary area along with its outer stretch of eco-sensitive zone where the livelihood practice is one-crop rain fed paddy and second is fishing; to live with dignity and enough food, protection of livelihood is the foremost for community’s resilience to disaster and climate change. Regeneration of mangroves, sustainable management of mangroves and eco-friendly farming practices the only option left with us to honor the legal regulations associated with the protected areas (Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary, Bhitarkanika National park, Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary and Eco-sensitive zone) and to face the changing climate.

            <Paragraph>
                The Green Climate Fund (GCF) funded project on “Enhancing Climate Resilience of India’s Coastal Communities-ECRICC” supports the Government of India, Odisha, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh to enhance climate resilience of the lives and livelihoods of the most vulnerable populations, particularly women, in the coastal areas of India to address climate change and extreme weather events, using an ecosystem-centered and community-based approach. Forest, Environment and Climate Change Department, Govt. of Odisha is the nodal department for overall supervision and implementation of the ECRICC project in the State and UNDP is the accredited agency of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to support the department during planning, implementation, and monitoring of the project.

                The project will help in integrating climate change adaptation – particularly ecosystem restoration and climate-adaptive livelihoods – into coastal management and planning in Odisha whose coastal population is vulnerable to extreme weather events and slow onset of climate impacts. In Kendrapara, Nature’s Club is the FNGO for implementation of the project in Bhitarkanika and Mahanadi Mouth Landscapes covering over 400 villages in Rajnagar, Rajkanika and Mahakalpada Blocks of the district. With a holistic vision, planned project interventions will provide direct benefits to over 70000 families in the 02 target landscapes.
