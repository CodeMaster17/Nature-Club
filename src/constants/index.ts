      "The old saying ‘Health is Wealth’ has the same value today despite all the developments in the world. Nutrition, especially of mothers and children is still the subject of concern in this modern world. 45% of children of Odisha are undernourished and it’s a big number. Quality health care is right of every human being. Nature’s Club’s concern about children’s health in hard to reach areas of Kendrapara district started its endeavor for and with children. Mothers’ health was inclusion by default. Later when we worked with adolescents, adolescent health and mainly health of adolescent girls as future mothers became our priority.",

      "Light a Billion Lives (LaBL) is a flagship program of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) to provide quality lighting to children and communities who are still deprived of it and that also green energy. Nature’s Club is working with TERI in partnership on clean energy solutions since 2009 establishing 22 Solar lantern units and 27 Solar mobile charging facilities in unelectrified villages of Kendrapara district. We got the opportunity to continue promoting solar technology as grid independent energy solution for household energy needs called Integrated Domestic Energy System (IDES) which addresses energy needs for cooking, Lighting and mobile charging. Improvised cook stoves (ICS) are designed for (1) No smoke, (2) Less fuel wood and (3) Less cooking time. Rural infrastructures like Solar lantern village hubs and solar mobile charging stations were implemented in 22 and 27 villages respectively in Rajnagar block of Kendrapara district. ",
